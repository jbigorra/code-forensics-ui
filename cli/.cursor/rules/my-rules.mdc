# TypeScript Usage
- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
- Avoid enums; use maps instead.

# Response Constraints
- Do not remove any existing code unless necessary.
- Do not remove my comments or commented-out code unless necessary.
- Do not change the formatting of my imports.
- Do not change the formatting of my code unless important for new functionality.

# Naming Conventions
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
- Favor named exports for components.
