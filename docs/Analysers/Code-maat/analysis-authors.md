# Authors Analysis

## Overview
The Authors analysis identifies and counts the number of different developers who have contributed to each entity (file/module) in your codebase. This analysis is based on research showing that the number of authors working on a module correlates with the number of quality problems that module exhibits.

## Analysis Type
**Command:** `authors`

## Purpose
- Identify modules with high developer turnover
- Find potential knowledge silos (single-author modules)
- Assess team collaboration patterns
- Identify modules that may benefit from code ownership clarification

## Input Requirements
- **Log file:** VCS log data containing commit information
- **Required columns:** `:author`, `:entity`, `:rev`

## Output Format
The analysis returns a CSV dataset with the following columns:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `entity` | The file or module path |
| `n-authors` | Number of unique authors who have modified this entity |
| `n-revs` | Total number of revisions/commits for this entity |

## Command Line Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
java -jar code-maat.jar -l logfile.log -c git2 -a authors
```

### With Options
```bash
# Limit output to top 20 results
java -jar code-maat.jar -l logfile.log -c git2 -a authors -r 20

# Save results to file
java -jar code-maat.jar -l logfile.log -c git2 -a authors -o authors-report.csv

# Filter by minimum revisions
java -jar code-maat.jar -l logfile.log -c git2 -a authors -n 10
```

## Configuration Options

### Filtering Options
- **`-n, --min-revs`** (default: 5): Minimum number of revisions required for an entity to be included in the analysis
- **`-r, --rows`**: Maximum number of rows to include in the output

### Output Options
- **`-o, --outfile`**: Write results to specified file instead of stdout

### Aggregation Options
- **`-g, --group`**: Aggregate results according to architectural layers defined in a group file
- **`-p, --team-map-file`**: Map individual authors to teams for organizational-level analysis

## Interpretation Guidelines

### High Author Count (Risk Indicators)
- **Many authors (>5-8):** May indicate:
  - Lack of clear ownership
  - Complex or problematic code requiring frequent fixes
  - Central/shared components
  - Potential quality issues

### Low Author Count
- **Single author:** May indicate:
  - Knowledge silos
  - Specialized components
  - Recent or rarely modified code

### Balanced Author Count (2-4 authors)
- Often indicates healthy collaboration
- Good knowledge distribution
- Manageable complexity

## Aggregation and Combination Possibilities

### Team-Level Analysis
```bash
# Analyze at team level instead of individual authors
java -jar code-maat.jar -l logfile.log -c git2 -a authors -p team-mapping.csv
```

**Team mapping file format (CSV):**
```csv
author,team
john.doe,backend-team
jane.smith,frontend-team
bob.wilson,backend-team
```

### Architectural Layer Analysis
```bash
# Aggregate by architectural boundaries
java -jar code-maat.jar -l logfile.log -c git2 -a authors -g layers.txt
```

**Layer grouping file format:**
```
UI Layer => src/main/webapp/.*
Business Layer => src/main/java/com/company/business/.*
Data Layer => src/main/java/com/company/data/.*
```

## Combining with Other Analyses

### Recommended Combinations
1. **Authors + Revisions:** Identify high-churn, multi-author files
2. **Authors + Coupling:** Find coupled modules with different ownership
3. **Authors + Churn:** Correlate author count with code stability
4. **Authors + Communication:** Analyze team communication patterns

### Sequential Analysis Example
```bash
# 1. Get author statistics
java -jar code-maat.jar -l git.log -c git2 -a authors -o authors.csv

# 2. Get revision counts
java -jar code-maat.jar -l git.log -c git2 -a revisions -o revisions.csv

# 3. Get coupling information
java -jar code-maat.jar -l git.log -c git2 -a coupling -o coupling.csv
```

## Research Background
This analysis is based on research findings that show:
- Files with more authors tend to have more defects
- The relationship between authors and defects is often stronger than traditional complexity metrics
- Author count can be an early indicator of problematic code areas

## Limitations
- Does not account for author expertise levels
- May not reflect current ownership if authors have left
- Temporal aspects are not considered (all contributions weighted equally)
- Refactoring activities may skew results

## Best Practices
1. **Combine with temporal analysis** to understand recent vs. historical contributions
2. **Use team mapping** for organizational insights
3. **Filter by minimum revisions** to focus on actively maintained code
4. **Cross-reference with coupling analysis** to identify architectural hotspots
5. **Regular monitoring** to track ownership evolution over time
