# For Typescript & Javascript projects
- You use jest as testing tool
- You use jest-mock-extended to create mocks
- You use fakerjs to fake (but realistic) data for testing and development.
- You use factory.ts to ease creation of factories for test data for Typescript
- You use cypress to create integration and e2e ui tests
- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
- Avoid enums; use maps instead.
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.
- Favor named exports for components.
